# Indicating_Stock
Indicating Stock (Indock) is machine learning based project to Indicate Behaviour of certain stock.
I proposed to use the LSTM algorithm to provide efficient stock prediction.They used a Long short-term memory network (LSTM). Long Short Term Memory networks – usually just called “LSTMs” In which I calculated the 100 days and 200 days moving average closing price to calculate the future value of stock manually
